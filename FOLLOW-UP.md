IMPLEMENTATION

1> I used CSS flexbox with react for styling components. Besides that I also used material-ui for buttons and icon for the frontend.

2> If you use "npm" => npm start OR "Yarn" => yarn start

GENERAL

1> If I had little more time I would like to get some finishing touch up to the design it's looks little rough right now and would like to add some css animations to the layout

2> Though it was not that great of a design compared to what how I had built previously but still I liked the layout of information presented for the flight details

3> I spend the most time setting up the flight information as I didn't use the json file for data. I found it quite difficult to load a particular element from the json file using map() method which I tried and so would have been better to have little time to go over how to get a single element from json file.

4> I found the test pretty good for assesment as it included many minute details which can be assessed by designing the elements which are important for anyone to know. I don't think I had any issues with the format as all the information was provided in the ddescription for each requirement.
